            <p><em>The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. 
                It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. 
                It appeared as a symbol for strength and nobility in cultures across Europe, Asia and Africa, despite incidents of attacks on people.</em></p>

                <li><strong>Scientific Name</strong>: Panthera leo</li>
                <li><strong>Average Length</strong>: 2 meters</li>
                <li><strong>Average Lifespan</strong>: 10 years</li>
                <li><strong>Habitat</strong>: Africa</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The lion has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
                It is a social species, forming groups. A lion group consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. 
                Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
                The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
