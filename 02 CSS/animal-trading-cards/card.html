				It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. 
				It appeared as a symbol for strength and nobility in cultures across Europe, Asia and Africa, despite incidents of attacks on people.</p>

			<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa. 
				It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
				It is a social species, forming groups. A lion group consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. 
				Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
				The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
