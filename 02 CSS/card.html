            <p><em>The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture.</em></p>
            <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Panthera leo</li>
                <li><span>Average Length</span>: 2 meters</li>

            <p>The lion has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
                The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
