# Animal Trading Card

The goal of this project is to replicate a design almost from scratch. In this case the design propotype was [this](https://github.com/pfrazao/udacity-introduction-to-programming/blob/main/02%20CSS/design-prototype.png).

The resulting code consists in a [HTML file](https://github.com/pfrazao/udacity-introduction-to-programming/blob/main/02%20CSS/card.html) and a [CSS file](https://github.com/pfrazao/udacity-introduction-to-programming/blob/main/02%20CSS/styles.css). The web page depicting the animal trading card can be found [here](https://introduction-to-programming.netlify.app/animal_trading_card/card.html).
